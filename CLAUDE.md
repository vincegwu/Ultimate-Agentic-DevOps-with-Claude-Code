## Project Overview

Static HTML/CSS portfolio website deployed to AWS using S3 and CloudFront, provisioned with Terraform, and automated via GitHub Actions.


## Architecture

Pure HTML5 and CSS3. No JavaScript. No build step. No framework.


## Commands

- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply


## Conventions

- All infrastructure changes go through Terraform - never modify AWS resources manually

- No JavaScript in this project

- CSS uses mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 900px, 768px, and 600px


## Safety

Never put secrets in this file. No API keys, passwords, or AWS credentials
